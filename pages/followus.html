        <h5 class="card-title">NASA MarsXR Challenge</h5>
        <p class="card-text">This challenge is seeking developers to create a new Virtual Reality (XR) research, development, and testing environment to help prepare for the experiences and situations that will be encountered on Mars. Participants will create new assets and scenarios for the new Mars XR Operations Support System (XOSS) environment, using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5. Solutions will focus on particular extravehicular activities (EVA) scenarios that will be used to test procedures and plan for conditions while on Mars. The goal is to create an immersive, engaging, and realistic experience.

        <h5 class="card-title">New Transonic Wind Tunnel Test Section</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The test section is where models are placed so that they will be exposed to the desired airflow generated by the wind tunnel to assess their performance under controlled conditions. The test sections must be configurable for many types of models (aircraft, rockets, engines, etc.) and will need to allow many types of measurements besides the standard pressure/lift/drag measurements. Data on acoustics, bending modes, and temperature gradients is of high interest in modern design trades. Specialized test sections are sometimes needed to capture data sets with high accuracy. Installing models and optimizing test sections for different types of measurements is time-consuming and reduces the amount of testing that can be done in a facility. The NASA Unitary Plan Wind tunnel! is an example of a facility that can direct its airflow to three separate test sections to increase facility throughput. Interchangeable test sections may be even more efficient. How would you design a wind tunnel facility with one or more test sections that can be efficiently and rapidly reconfigured by multiple test teams so that facility utilization can be maximized? While new models are being installed and integrated into the test section, the wind tunnel is not running which results in reduced utilization. Operational efficiencies are an area of improvement in the design of the facilities’ test section which could increase performance and cost effectiveness. The ability of the test team to rapidly swap out models is a lot like the capabilities of a race car pit crew to the overall efficiency of a wind tunnel. This contest is in support of a NASA concept study called the “New Wind Tunnel Landscape.” The goal of the study is to develop several options to support the future wind tunnel testing required in the next 20-50 years. The test section design is one aspect of what might enhance the effectiveness of future wind tunnels. In addition to swapping out models, researchers may want to configure the test section itself for different test objectives (e.g. sound abatement for acoustic measurement accuracy, optical windows for laser metrology on structural dynamics).

        <h5 class="card-title">Break the Ice Lunar Challenge Phase 2</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Description of Challenge: The Break the Ice Lunar Challenge seeks to incentivize innovative approaches for excavating icy regolith and delivering acquired resources in extreme lunar environmental conditions. NASA has identified several technology gaps related to harvesting and moving large quantities of resources on the Moon, including hardware capable of operating in the extreme cold and permanent to near-permanent darkness. Robotic systems for excavation will need to withstand the harsh environments inside permanently shadowed regions at the lunar South Pole, the targeted landing site for crewed Artemis missions where ice has been observed. Teams must show that their solutions address reliability, durability, and traversability challenges these systems must overcome to operate for long durations.

          Phase 2 of the challenge offers a total prize purse of $3M.
          
          Phase 1 of Break the Ice Lunar opened in November 2020 and challenged teams to design a system architecture for collecting and moving large amounts of icy regolith and water from a permanently shadowed region near the Moon’s South Pole. Competitors had seven months to register and submit a detailed system architecture, an excavation plan, and an animation of the system in operation. In August 2021, 13 winners were awarded a total of $500,000.
          
          NASA invites previous participants as well as new teams to compete in Phase 2.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Description: The prize competition, the MSI Space Accelerator, comes from a new partnership between NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, the Minority University Research Education Project within the Office of STEM Engagement, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California, and Starburst Accelerator in Los Angeles.

          The MSI Space Accelerator competition is designed to engage under-represented academic institutions and help NASA make significant advancements in the areas of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the development of autonomous systems. For this pilot challenge, the technical focus is to create systems that operate without human oversight for future science missions. NASA invites participation from minority serving institutions that can offer capabilities in the design and/or demonstration of tools that can perform effective monitoring of such autonomous systems to diagnose problems, and optimize, reconfigure, and recover from failure. These systems should learn and adapt to improve their behavior over time, including acquiring, modifying, and transforming their activities by augmenting their knowledge on how to perform tasks more effectively and efficiently.
